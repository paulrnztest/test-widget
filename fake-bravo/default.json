  "relevantInfo": [
    "Top-up / payment channels recently had a **known issue** affecting some self-service top-ups and payments; advisors should be aware this may explain unexpected behaviour, but the issue is **now resolved** and BAU applies.",
    "Refund or credit decisions must follow standard (BAU) refund/billing processes, as there is **no special exception process documented** here for duplicate top-up packs."
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "Check the customer’s recent top-up history and pack activations to confirm whether two identical packs were purchased and successfully applied, and if this **coincides with the reported self-service issue window**.",
    "Follow BAU refund/credit assessment and processing for mobile/prepaid where applicable, documenting the situation clearly (double charge, no intent to buy two packs) and whether any system error is suspected."
  ],
  "suggestedReply": "Thanks for letting us know what’s happened, that does sound frustrating.\n\nI’ll first take a look at your recent top-ups to confirm what was charged and which packs have actually been applied. Once I can see exactly what’s gone through, I’ll review whether we can reverse or credit one of those pack purchases for you and talk you through the options.\n\nI’ll come back to you shortly with what I find and what we can do next.",
