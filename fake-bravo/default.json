  "suggestedReply": "Thanks for letting me know you’ve changed plans – that’s really helpful. When a plan changes, the first bill afterwards can look higher because it can include part of your old plan, part of your new plan, and any credits or adjustments for the changeover. I’ll pull up your last bill and this month’s bill now and break down exactly what’s different so you can see what’s one‑off for the change and what your regular monthly cost will be going forward.",
